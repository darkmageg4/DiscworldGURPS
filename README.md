Character sheet manager for Discworld GURPS game

I have created this character sheet manager as a labour of love and also to improve my java skills.
All my code is here, if you want to look at it (created in NetBeans) or you can just use the DiscworldGURPSSetup.exe to install the sheet.

I have no intention of ever making money off this and, if it goes down well and works well, I will probably share it with Steve Jackson Games.

Have fun!
